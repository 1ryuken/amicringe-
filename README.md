## The Vibe Check (How This Shit Works)

Yo, this app is straight bussin' fr fr! We built this dumpster fire to expose all those cringe-ass Instagram profiles that be flexing too hard. Here's the tea on how we cooked this up:

## The Workflow (AKA How We Built This Monstrosity)

No cap, this project was built during a fever dream fueled by energy drinks and spite. The workflow was basically:
- Yeet some code at 3 AM when normal people sleep
- Find out it's broken af the next morning
- Google that shit while eating cold pizza
- Stack Overflow copypasta faster than you can say "rizz"
- Debug by randomly commenting out lines until something works
- Commit with messages like "idk why this works but don't touch it"
- Push to main because we're living life on the edge
- Repeat until it kinda works or we pass out, whichever comes first

We don't collect your data cuz we deadass don't care enough to store it. This is peak "I made this because I could, not because I should" energy. The entire project was built by a squad of sleep-deprived goblins who thought "what if we could numerically quantify someone's lack of game?"
